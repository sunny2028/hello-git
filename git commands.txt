Following are some of the commands used in git bash to keep track of the changes made in the file:-
1. $git init                 (it creates a .git folder which monitors all the files in that folder)

2. $git add <filename>       (this command will help git to track the content of this particular file)
 
3. $git status               (this cmd shows all the files that git is "tracking" and also those which are not being tracked by git)
                             (if there is any change made to the files being monitored, it will show in the status)

4. $git commit -m  "version 1"( "commit" means to create a checkpoint( or a version), but this may not work first time)

// before using this command we have to introduce ourself to git

5.$git config:-(to introduce ourself to git)
(i) $git config --global user.name "tarun tej bawa"
(ii)$git config --global user.email "tejasbawa9@gmail.com"

//...now the commit cmd should be working 

6. $git remote add origin "repository address"
 ( this helps to link the local repsitory to the remote repository(like on github))

7. $git push -u origin master    (this command will upload your files to the remote repository)
